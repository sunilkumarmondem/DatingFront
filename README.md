This project is about DATING APP.

For front end we are using Angular 12.

To install this application in your system locally, First clone the whole project and later install all the required dependencies in your system locally.

This project is not completely with end to end features. This project is just for practice, how to use Angular and .net6.

However, we can improve this project by using SignalIr, to look application more realistic. But for Demo puropse, I did not use SignalIr.
